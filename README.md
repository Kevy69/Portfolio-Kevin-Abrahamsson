# Me? you'd like to know about me? <br><sup>Why, thanks for asking!</sup>


- An engineer at heart with a burning passion for Physics, Engineering (duh) and computers.
- The humor of a 13 year old, the internal dialouge of a 50 some, and the actual age of 21.
- An optimistic fool with a nasty habit of biting off more than he can chew.
- Native level English speaker, while at the same time being terrible at my true native language of Swedish. Also fluent in Persian. ~~Pretty random, huh.~~
