# Me? you'd like to know me?
## Why, thanks for asking!

- An engineer at heart with a burning passion for Physics, Engineering (duh) and computers.
- The humor of a 13 year old, the internal dialouge of a 50 some, and an actual age of 21.
- An optimistic fool to the N'th power, with a nasty habit of biting off more than i can chew.
- beyond proficient in English and terrible at Swedish, while also knowing Persian. ~~Pretty random, huh.~~
